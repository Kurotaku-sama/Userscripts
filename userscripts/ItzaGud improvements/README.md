## Description

This userscript adds various optional enhancements to [ItzaGud.net](https://itzagud.net).
All features can be enabled or disabled individually in the integrated configuration menu, which is accessible via a button in the top bar (desktop) or bottom mobile nav.

## Features

- Convert GudCoinz into approximate USD value (configurable rate)
- Collapse comments by default with a toggle button
- Add buttons to batch-open all daily, weekly, or one-time missions (currently broken due to timewall)
- On video mission pages, autoplay videos with controls and muted sound (currently broken)
- Dedicated settings button in both desktop and mobile layout

---

## Notes

- GudCoinz conversion is based on a custom conversion rate (default: 2500 = $0.01)
- The comment section toggle places the comment box above the hidden comments
- Batch mission buttons only appear on the mission page
- Video autoplay might fail if the video is blocked or misconfigured
