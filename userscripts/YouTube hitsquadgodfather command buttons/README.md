## Description

This userscript adds a panel with command buttons similar like the old version of **[Twitch command buttons](/userscripts/Twitch%20command%20buttons/README.md)** to the YouTube live chat interface, specifically designed for on-stream minigames used during HitsquadGodfather's streams.

Each button sends a specific command into the live chat. This was intended to speed up interactions during events like trivia, team battles, or RPG-style encounters in the stream.

## Features

- Adds grouped command buttons for:
  - General commands (`!hitsquad`, `!points`, etc.)
  - Trivia answers (1â€“4)
  - Showdown Buttons
- Targeting system for Showdown attacks

## Notes

- Buttons appear only if the live chat contains `HitsquadGodfather`
- The script may still be useful as a base for similar live chat automation tasks
